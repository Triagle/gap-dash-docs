#+TITLE: Dash Docsets for GAP and FinInG

This repo contains compiled docsets for the [[https://www.gap-system.org/][GAP]] programming language and the
[[https://www.gap-system.org/Packages/fining.html][FinInG]] package for GAP. The compiled docsets are for version GAP version 4.11.1
and FinInG version 1.4.1 using the HTML documentation provided from the Arch

documentation for other GAP packages, and for future versions provided the
layout of the manual remains constant.
